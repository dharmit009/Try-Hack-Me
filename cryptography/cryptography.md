# Symmetric Encryption:

> It uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data. This algorithms are faster than asymmetric cryptography and uses smaller keys (128 or 256 bits and 56 in case of DES)

Examples of Symmetric encryption are:

1. DES (Already Broken).
1. AES.

# Asymmetric Encryption:

> Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys, one to encyrpt and the other in the pair to decrypt. Normally this keys are referred as public and private key. They tend to be slower and uses larger keys. RSA typically uses 2048 to 4096 bit keys. But it has it's advantage too it mathematically intraceable problem.

Examples of Asymmetric encryption are: 

1. RSA.
1. Elliptic Curve.

### Key Terms realted to Cryptography.

CipherText -> Encrypted data of plain text files.
Cipher 		 -> Method for encrypting and decrypting.
Plaintext  -> Data before encryption. 
Encryption -> Transformation of data into ciphertext. 
Encoding   -> Just a data representation. Immediately reversible.
key        -> A key to decrypt the CipheredText.
Passphrase -> Similar to passwords and used to protect keys. 
Asymmetric encryption -> Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt. 
Symmetric encryption -> Uses same keys to encrypt and decrypt. 
Brute force -> Attacking cryptography by trying every possible password or key. 
cryptanalysis -> Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in underlying maths. 
Alice and Bob - Used to represent 2 people who generally want to communicate. Theyâ€™re named Alice and Bob because this gives them the initials A and B. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob for more information, as these extend through the alphabet to represent many different people involved in communication.
