# Windows

The Windows Operating system has been around for almost 36 yearsthat is from 1985 to 2021. It has been the dominant operating system all over the world for home use as well as corporate use. 

There are various versions of windows some of them are as follows: 
1. Windows xp.
1. Windows vista. 
1. Windows 7. 
1. Windows 8.
1. Windows 10. 
1. Windows 11. (THE LATEST)

## Difference between home and pro versions.

From Windows 7, Microsoft decided to provide even more options to the user with specific needs. One of such needs was to being able to encrypt your data on the go which they started to provide using different versions. (i.e Bitlocker encryption)

*Note*: There are many difference between home and pro version but only one is listed here. 

## What is UAC? 
> UAC stands for User Account Control. When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions. When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. 

*Note*: UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator account. 

# Windows File System. 

The modern windows operating system uses New Technology File System a.k.a `NTFS`. Before NTFS, there was FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System).

## NTFS

> NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.   

### Limitations which NTFS Overcamed: 

1. Supports files larger than 4GB
1. Set specific permissions on folders and files
1. Folder and file compression
1. Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)
