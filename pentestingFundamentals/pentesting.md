# Pentesting Fundamentals:

## What is Pentesting?

**Pentesting** is ethical way to test and analyse security systems by
breaking into the system. We also need to provide a detail report on
what we did, why we did, how we did and also how can that event be
reproduced. 

## Type's Of Hacker's

* White Hat Hacker:

The White Hat Hacker's are generally considered as the "Good People".
They remain with the confined boundaries of laws and use their skills to
protect systems. 

* Grey Hat Hacker: 

The Grey Hat Hacker use their skills to help others but they are not
always ethical sometimes, they do cross the boundaries in order to the
breakage of the system.

* Black Hat Hacker: 

The Black Hat Hacker's are people considered criminals, but that isn't
true as some Black Hat Hackers are fighting for social cause. They don't
usually care about the law. They break into systems for their own
benefit or either for information which could very valuable. 

## Rules Of Engagement (ROE)

This is one of the most important document in the field of pentesting.
The document consist of three main sections namely:

* Permissions: Authorization for pentesting. 

* Test Scope: Specific targets on which you can work and cannot work. 

* Rules: What are you allowed to do and what are you are not allowed to
  do. 

## Pentesting Methodologies

The Pentesting methodlogy states that there are 5 steps you need to
perform in a pentest. They are as follows:

1. Information Gathering.
1. Enumeration or Scanning.
1. Exploitation.
1. Privilege Escalation. 
1. Post Exploitation.

* **Information Gathering:**

In Information Gathering, Pentesters are suppose to find publicly
available data of the company or the individual like email addresses,
Phone numbers, social media account handles, Bills, ID card, whatever
that could be used against them. One of the key things to note here is
this step **does not include scanning.**

* **Enumeration Or Scanning:**

In Enumeration, we scan for application and services running on their
system typically this involves port scanning for tcp and udp to check
for ports which are being used by the system and to find vulnerability. 

* **Exploitation:**

In Exploitation, we exploit vulnerable services using different
techniques in order to try to get access of the machine. 

* **Privilege Escalation:**

Privilege escalation is a process of accessing higher privileges for the
exploited system. 

* **Post Exploitation:**

Post Exploitation is process of expanding your exploit through various
host within the network, gather more information, cover your tracks, and
generating reports on the same. 

### Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

The OSSTM provides a framework for testing systems, software
applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity. 


The method primarily focuses on the following:

1. Telecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc). 
1. Wired Networks. 
1. Wireless Communications. 

**Advantages:**

1. Covers Various Testing Strategies In-depth. 
1. Includes testing strategies for specific targets. 
1. The Framework is modular which could be molded to anything depending
on an organisation needs. 
1. The framework is universally applicable to any pentesting scenarios. 

**Disadvantages:**

1. Need to know all the detailed Unique Definitions. 

### Open Web Application Security Project (OWSAP)

The **OWASP** framework is mainly used to test the security of web
applications and services. The **OWASP** top ten is one of the most well
respected reports on web app pentesting. 

**Advantages:**

1. Easy to understand and pick up. 
1. Actively maintained and gets updated frequently. 
1. Covers all stages of engagement from testing to reporting. 
1. It Specialises in web applications and services.

**Disadvantages:**

1. The framework doesn't hold any accreditation.
1. **OWASP** does not make any specific development life cycles. 

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1

**NIST** stands for National Institute Of Standard And Technology. The
NIST framework is primarily used to improve the security of the
organisation and to manage the risk of cyber threats. 

**Advantages:**

1. The NIST framework is estimated to be used by 50% of American
Organisations. 
1. The framework is extremely detailed in setting standards to help
organisations to mitigate the threat posed by cyber threats. 
1. The framework is very frequently updated. 

**Disadvantages:**

1. NIST has many iterations of frameworks, so it may be difficult to
decide which one applies to your organisation.
1. The NIST framework has weak auditing policies, making it difficult to
determine how a breach occurred
1. The framework does not consider cloud computing, which is quickly
becoming increasingly popular for organisations.

### National Cyber Security Centre Cyber Assement Framework (NCSC CAF)

The **NCSC CAF** is an extensive framework with 14 different principles
used to assess the risk of various cyber threats. 

The framework is used in critical infrastructures like banking. The
framework mainly focuses on the following topics:

* Data Security. 
* System Security. 
* Identity and Access Control. 
* Resiliency. 
* Monitoring. 
* Response and Recovery Planning. 

**Advantages:** 

1. The framework is backed by government. 
1. The framework provides accreditation. 

**Disadvantages:** 

1. The framework is still new in industry meaning it is not very flexible. 
1. The framework is based on principles and ideas which also means it does not have direct rules as other frameworks. 

### Black, Grey, and White Box

* **Black Box Testing:**

In *Black Box Testing*, the tester is not provided any
information about the inner workings of the application or the
service. Typically this type of testing generally does not require
any knowledge of programming. 

* **Grey Box Testing:**

In *Grey Box Testing*, the tester will be provided with limited
knowledge of internal working of the application or the service. 

* **White Box Testing:**

In *White Box Testing*, the tester will be provided with the full
knowledge of the application. Here its the job of tester to test entire
functionality of the application
