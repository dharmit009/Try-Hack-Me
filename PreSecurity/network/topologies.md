# LAN TOPOLOGIES

When networks are connected in different ways those variations are known as network topology. 

## STAR TOPOLOGY

> The network has a central hub or a switch through which all the other networking devices are connected. This topology is most commonly used today despite it cost. 

### Advantages
1. Highly Scalability. 
2. Highly Reliable. 

### Disadvantages
1. Expensive. 
2. High Maintainance. 
3. Troubleshooting is pain. 
4. Central device failure will result too entire loss of network.

## Bus Topology

The Bus topology relies on a single connection through which branches are created to connect to the network. 

### Advantages

1. Easier to set up. 
2. less costly. 

### Disadvantages

1. Gets bottlenecked with multiple requests. 
2. Point of failure is the backbone cable / single connection. 

----

## Ring Topology

The Ring topology is also known as the `token topology`. In this variant the computer are connected directly to one another in order to form a loop. 

### Advantages
1. Easy Troubleshooting. 
2. Less Prone to bottleneck. 


### Disadvantages

1. Not Efficient. 
2. Point of failure: All the point are point of failure if one goes down the entire network goes down.

# Router

A routers is used to connect different networks and pass data between them. This task is done by performing routing which is a process of data travelling across networks. 

Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered. 

# Switch

Switches are devices used to aggregate devices such as computer, printer, or any other networking capable device using ethernet. Switches are normally used in large organizations like a school or a business company as the number of devices are quite high. 

Switches use a technology known as `packet switching` through which data is broken down into smaller pieces known as packets.
